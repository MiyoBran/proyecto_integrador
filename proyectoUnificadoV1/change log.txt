--------------------------------------------------------------
Main function
part 1:
Changed name of bool gameEnd to gameStop since there is already a bool called like that inside the buttons struct
Changed name of endRound to roundEnd to keep with the naming style choosen
Added bool called playerWin, which comes into play to tell the player if they won the round or not

Added "playerWin = false;" in line 135, after the player gets more than 21 points
Added "playerWin = false;" in line 163, after player clicks on continue playing

there were two examples of if (playerWins) do this. One from line 128 to 132 and another one after the round ends
I deleted both
added if (playerWins) structure in line 169

Realized you can click the buttons after the round ends, fixed that by adding "&& !roundEnd" to if structures that detect mouse click
in lines 90, 102 and 120

part 2:
lines 10 to 47
Made functions in main so decks, player points and money can be changed by logical part

lines 52 to 83
Changed positions of variables before the main loop

line 51
added random seed for card deck.

line 148
added "playerPoints = calculatePoints(playerDeck, &amountCardsPlayer);"

line 162
added "playerWin = randomWin(playerWin);" just to test

line 171 and 172
Moved printCard functions to the end so that they are together

line 193 and 194
added "getCard(playerDeck);" and "getCard(dealerDeck);" so that a new deck is drawn after player continues the game

line 195
added "playerPoints = calculatePoints(playerDeck, &amountCardsPlayer);" so that new player points are added

line 211 to 216
added new else if to consider the situation in which the player goes beyond 21 points

graphics_storage.h
