void getCard(myDeck *deck, int *amountCards);
int calculatePoints(myDeck *deck, int *amountCards);
bool compareScores(int puntajeJugador, int puntajeCroupier);

int getPlayerMoney(int playerMoney, int bet, bool playerWin);
void getCard(myCard *deck, int *amountCards);
int calculatePoints(myCard *deck, int *amountCards);
bool compareScores(int puntajeJugador, int puntajeCroupier);


---------------
  gamelogic.c
---------------
Changed the way compareScores worked, now it only compares scores between dealer and player
Changed getPlayerMoney, for some reason I used a pointer before, dunno why. Also deleted the line 'int money = 10000'

added allowBlackjackWin, which checks if the player got a blackjack on the first hand
added playerAbove21, which checks if someone went above 21 points
Moved startRound from graphics_storage.h to gamelogic.h, which sets the variables to start a new round
