MAX_CARDS_DISPLAYED is not marked as a comment anymore

line 107
added currentGame->allowMoneyUpdate = true;

changed playerAbove21 function from this:
bool playerAbove21(int points, gameState *currentGame) {
    if (points > 21) {
        currentGame->allowMoneyUpdate = true;
        currentGame->roundEnd = true;   
        return true;     
    }
    return false;
}
to this:

bool playerAbove21(int points) {
    if (points > 21) {
        return true;     
    }
    return false;
}

extern int MAX_CARDS_DISPLAYED is now located in this line instead of line 5, dunno why I made this change

Lines 80 to 91
changed comments to be above functions so they show up when hovering on their names
